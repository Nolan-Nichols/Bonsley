A Recipe Website and Database

Cooking is cool and sometimes I forget the ingredients that I used to make dinner last night. So with that, I decided to work on a simple recipe site that allows a user to quickly whip up a list of ingredients, a recipe description, etc., I've been trying to refactor my old site (well, start over from srcatch) to test my knowledge with working the front end and back end. I hope to get this sucker all done by the summer of 2019.
