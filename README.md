A Recipe Website and Database for managing and viewing delicious recipies quickly!

Cooking is cool and sometimes I forget the ingredients that I used to make dinner last night. So with that, I decided to work on a simple recipe site that allows a user to quickly whip up a list of ingredients, a recipe description, etc., I've been trying to refactor my old site (well, start over from srcatch) to test my knowledge with working the front end and back end. I hope to get this sucker all done by the summer of 2019. 

This project utilizes a bunch of JavaScript, PHP and some Ajax and Jquery here and there.  Maybe someday I'll switch over to Node.js...

Since this has been a wonderful learning process and created for the intention of being used on a private network, I would not recommend copy pasta-ing code for public use. If you do, I would highly suggest looking into further security measures.
